These meteors also usually lack persistent trains but can produce fireballs. These meteors are best seen from the northern hemisphere where the radiant is high in the sky at dawn. Activity from this shower can be seen from the southern hemisphere, but at a lower rate.","id":"c03ea47d-fbef-438f-8e90-4520226f4679"},{"id":"e1","title":"Quadrantid Meteor Shower","date":"Jan. 3–4","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/62e8e87ebae872f3f3373b0b/Gemini-meteor-shower/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=960","description":"The Quadrantids (QUA) are a meteor shower that peaks in early January and whose radiant lies in the constellation Boötes. The zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) of this shower can be as high as that of two other reliably rich meteor showers, the Perseids in August and the Geminids in December,[4] yet Quadrantid meteors are not seen as often as those of the two other showers because the time frame of the peak is exceedingly narrow, sometimes lasting only hours. Moreover, the meteors are quite faint, with mean apparent magnitudes between 3.0 and 6.0."},{"id":"e2","title":"Perseid Meteoric Shower","date":"11-12-13 Agust","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9xUxE2FptNBRT6zgXUVWx7-970-80.jpg.webp","description":"The Perseids are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Swift–Tuttle. The meteors are called the Perseids because the point from which they appear to hail (called the radiant) lies in the constellation Perseus. The name is derived from the word Perseidai (Greek: Περσείδαι), the sons of Perseus in Greek mythology."},{"id":"e3","title":"Ursid Meteoric Shower","date":"Aug. 11–13","image":"https://www.bizsiziz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Perseid-Meteor-Shower-Time-Lapse-Photo.jpg","description":"The Ursid (URS) meteor activity begins annually around December 17 and runs for over a week, until the 25th or 26th.

The Comet of origin is not known with certainty. Suspected candidate is Comet 96P Machholz. Earlier, it was thought to have originated from the Marsden and Kracht Sungrazing comets."}]}
